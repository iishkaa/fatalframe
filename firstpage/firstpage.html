        Please don't search for me.<br>
        Please don't.<br>
        It's not your fault that I <del>am here</del> left.<br>
        But it's safer that way.<br>
        Forget about me.<br>
        I don't even know what would they do if they'd found out.<br>
        Or found you here...<br>
        You have to forget and let go.
